/// Executes only against a deep, server-validated connection snapshot. The existing ID-only pool
/// exposes neither its creation configuration nor a validated execution lease, so borrowing it here
/// would recreate the TOCTOU defect. Verification uses a privately owned driver instead; ordinary
/// development/collection requests still use the pool. No later ID lookup can redirect this driver.
/// A fresh repository scope after I/O also detects edits during execution; it is not the protection
/// against rerouting (the frozen ConnectAsync input is). Do not reuse an EF tracked entity to check
/// for edits, and do not log the snapshot, credentials, or raw SDK exceptions.
